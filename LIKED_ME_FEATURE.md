# Liked Me Feature Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive "Liked Me" feature has been added to the Zawaj app, allowing users to see who has liked them and make informed decisions about matching. The tab bar has been redesigned with Discovery as the center tab for better UX.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend API Endpoint
**File:** `backend/src/routes/swipes.ts`

- **New Endpoint:** `GET /swipes/liked-me`
- Returns a list of users who have right-swiped (liked) the current user
- Intelligently filters out:
  - Users already matched with
  - Users already swiped on (left or right)
  - **Users not eligible to swipe back** (role compatibility check)
- Role eligibility validation ensures no 422 errors when swiping
- Returns only genuine "pending likes" that require action
- Ordered by most recent likes first

**Key Logic:**
```typescript
// Fetches all right swipes directed at the current user
// Excludes users who are already matched or swiped on
// Filters by role eligibility (prevents 422 errors on swipe)
// Example: Male users only see females who liked them
// Returns clean list ready for the UI
```

### 2. Frontend Screen - LikedMeScreen
**File:** `mobile/src/screens/LikedMeScreen.tsx`

#### Design Features:
- **Card Grid Layout:** Beautiful 2-column grid of user cards
- **Photo Display:** Shows user's primary photo with blur mode respected
- **User Info Overlay:** Name, age, and location overlaid on photos
- **Mother Badge:** Special indicator for users with "mother" role
- **Responsive Design:** Cards scale properly on different screen sizes
- **Loading States:** Elegant empty state when no likes exist
- **Pull to Refresh:** Users can refresh the list manually

#### User Interaction:
1. **Card Click:** Opens ProfileDetailModal with full user details
2. **Like Action:** 
   - Swipes right on the user
   - Creates a match if mutual like exists
   - Shows match modal on successful match
   - Removes user from liked-me list
   - Shows error alert if action fails
3. **Pass Action:** 
   - Swipes left on the user
   - Removes from liked-me list immediately
   - Shows error alert if action fails
4. **Auto-Refresh:** List updates after any action
5. **Processing Protection:** Prevents double-clicks during API calls

#### Empty State:
- Large icon with descriptive message
- Encourages users to continue swiping in Discovery
- Professional, friendly design

### 3. Enhanced Navigation & Tab Bar
**File:** `mobile/src/navigation/index.tsx`

#### Tab Organization (RTL - Right to Left):
1. **Settings** (الإعدادات)
2. **Matches** (التوافقات)
3. **Discovery** (استكشاف) - **CENTER TAB** ⭐
4. **Liked Me** (أعجبتهم) - **NEW**
5. **Profile** (الملف الشخصي)

#### Enhanced Tab Bar Design:
- **Icon-Only Design:** Text labels removed for cleaner, modern look
- **Adaptive Height:** 80px base + safe area inset (covers elevated Discovery icon)
- **Solid Background:** Clean dark background using theme card color (#141a31)
- **Raised Background:** Extends high enough to cover all icons including elevated Discovery tab
- **Border:** Subtle top border using theme border color
- **Smart Padding:** 
  - Top: 24px (positions icons lower in the tab bar)
  - Bottom: Dynamic based on device safe area (min 5px)
- **Safe Area Support:** Properly handles iPhone X+ home indicator area

#### Discovery Tab Special Treatment:
- **Circular Button:** 60x60px rounded button (center focal point)
- **Elevated Design:** Raised above other tabs with prominent shadow
- **Dynamic Shadow:** Enhanced glowing shadow when active
- **Color Transition:** 
  - Active: Accent pink background (#fe3c72) with black icon
  - Inactive: Dark surface background with muted icon
- **Icon Size:** 30px icon (vs 26px for other tabs)

#### LikedMe Tab Badge:
- **Live Count:** Shows number of users who liked you
- **Auto-Update:** Refreshes every 30 seconds
- **Smart Display:** Only shows when count > 0
- **Styling:** Accent color badge with bold number
- **Position:** Top-right of the tab icon

#### Regular Tab Icons:
- **Size:** 26px icons for all non-Discovery tabs
- **Colors:** Accent pink when active, muted gray when inactive
- **Spacing:** Evenly distributed across tab bar
- **Touch Targets:** 70px height ensures comfortable tapping

### 4. Integration with Existing Features

#### ProfileDetailModal
The modal now supports three modes:
1. **Match View:** Only "Open Chat" button (existing matches)
2. **Discovery View:** Like, Pass, Super Like buttons (discovery swipes)
3. **Liked Me View:** Like and Pass buttons (from liked-me screen) ✨ **NEW**
   - Buttons are disabled during processing to prevent double-clicks
   - Proper error handling with user-friendly Arabic error messages
   - Haptic feedback on success and error

#### Swipe System Integration:
- Uses existing `/swipes` endpoint for match/pass actions

## Technical Details

### API Response Format
```typescript
{
  users: [
    {
      id: string;
      display_name: string;
      dob: string;
      city: string;
      country: string;
      role: 'male' | 'female' | 'mother';
      mother_for?: 'son' | 'daughter';
      photos: [{ id: string; url: string; ordering: number; blurred: boolean }];
      privacy_blur_mode: boolean;

    }
  ]
}
```

### React Query Keys
