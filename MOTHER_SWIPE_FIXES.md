# Mother Users Swipe & Liked Me Fixes

## Critical Update: Swipe-Back Logic

**Important:** After initial implementation, we discovered that the bidirectional eligibility in `/liked-me` was showing users correctly, but the `/swipes` endpoint was still rejecting swipe-backs with 422 errors.

**Final Solution:** Implemented **swipe-back logic** in the `/swipes` endpoint:
- If someone has already swiped you, you can always swipe them back (regardless of normal eligibility rules)
- This allows reciprocal swiping in all scenarios where one party initiated

```typescript
// Check if this is a "swipe-back" (target user already swiped me)
const theySwipedMe = await prisma.swipe.findFirst({
  where: { 
    from_user_id: to_user_id, 
    to_user_id: me.id 
  },
});

// Allow swipe if either:
// 1. Normal eligibility rules pass, OR
// 2. This is a swipe-back (they already swiped me)
if (!eligible && !theySwipedMe) {
  return res.status(422).json({ error: 'Not eligible to swipe this user' });
}
```

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Mothers Don't Show Up in "Liked Me" ‚úÖ

**Problem:** When a mother user (e.g., Mother for son) liked another user (e.g., Female), the recipient would not see the mother in their "Liked Me" tab.

**Root Cause:** The eligibility check in the `/swipes/liked-me` endpoint was **unidirectional**. It only checked if the current user could swipe the person who liked them, not if that person was eligible to swipe them in the first place.

**Example Scenario:**
- Mother (for son) ‚úì can swipe Female
- Mother swipes right on Female ‚Üí swipe saved
- Female goes to "Liked Me" tab
- Eligibility check: "Can Female swipe Mother?" ‚Üí ‚ùå (Female can only swipe Male)
- Mother is filtered out and not shown

**Solution:** Made the eligibility check **bidirectional** in `/swipes/liked-me` endpoint:

```typescript
const isEligible = (targetUser: any) => {
  const targetRole = normalizeRole(targetUser.role);
  const targetMotherFor = (targetUser.mother_for || '').toLowerCase();
  
  // Check if I can swipe them OR if they can swipe me (bidirectional)
  const iCanSwipeThem = (() => {
    if (myRole === 'male') return targetRole === 'female';
    if (myRole === 'female') return targetRole === 'male';
    if (myRole === 'mother' && myMotherFor === 'son') 
      return targetRole === 'female' || (targetRole === 'mother' && targetMotherFor === 'daughter');
    if (myRole === 'mother' && myMotherFor === 'daughter') 
      return targetRole === 'male' || (targetRole === 'mother' && targetMotherFor === 'son');
    return false;
  })();
  
  const theyCanSwipeMe = (() => {
    if (targetRole === 'male') return myRole === 'female';
    if (targetRole === 'female') return myRole === 'male';
    if (targetRole === 'mother' && targetMotherFor === 'son') 
      return myRole === 'female' || (myRole === 'mother' && myMotherFor === 'daughter');
    if (targetRole === 'mother' && targetMotherFor === 'daughter') 
      return myRole === 'male' || (myRole === 'mother' && myMotherFor === 'son');
    return false;
  })();
  
  return iCanSwipeThem || theyCanSwipeMe;
};
```

**Impact:** 
- Females can now see Mothers (for son) who liked them
- Males can now see Mothers (for daughter) who liked them
- Mothers (for son) can now see Mothers (for daughter) who liked them
- Mothers (for daughter) can now see Mothers (for son) who liked them

### 2. 422 Errors When Swiping from "Liked Me" ‚úÖ

**Problem:** After fixing issue #1, users could see people who liked them in the "Liked Me" tab, but when trying to swipe back, they got 422 errors (especially for Female swiping on Mother, or Male swiping on Mother).

**Root Cause:** The `/liked-me` endpoint was using bidirectional eligibility to **show** users, but the `/swipes` endpoint was still enforcing unidirectional eligibility rules. This created a disconnect where users could see someone in "Liked Me" but couldn't actually swipe them.

**Solution:** Implemented swipe-back logic in the `/swipes` endpoint (see above). Now if someone has already swiped you, you can always swipe them back, regardless of normal eligibility rules.

**Impact:** All swipe-backs from "Liked Me" tab now work correctly without 422 errors.

### 3. Likes of Mothers Don't Register ‚úÖ

**Problem:** When a mother user tried to swipe right on someone, the swipe would fail or not register properly.

**Root Cause:** Missing validation for target user's `mother_for` field. If the target user was a mother without `mother_for` set, the eligibility check could fail silently.

**Solution:** Added validation for target user's `mother_for` field in the `/swipes` endpoint:

```typescript
// Validate target user's mother_for if they are a mother
if (toUser.role === 'mother' && !toUser.mother_for) {
  console.error('‚ùå Target mother user missing mother_for:', toUser.id, toUser.display_name);
  return res.status(422).json({ error: 'Target user has invalid account state' });
}
```

**Impact:** 
- Swipes from mother users now validate both the current user and target user's `mother_for` fields
- Better error messages for invalid account states
- Prevents silent failures

### 4. Match Celebration Animation in "Liked Me" ‚úÖ

**Problem:** When matching with a user from the "Liked Me" tab, the match celebration animation was not playing sounds and haptics like it does in the Discovery screen.

**Root Cause:** The LikedMeScreen was missing:
- The `feedback.match()` call for celebration sounds and haptics
- The 100ms delay before showing the modal for better UX timing
- Separate `showMatchModal` state for cleaner control

**Solution:** Updated `LikedMeScreen.tsx` to match the Discovery screen's celebration behavior:

```typescript
// If a match was created, show match modal with celebration
if (result.match) {
  setMatchedUser(selectedUser);
  
  // Play match celebration sound and haptics
  feedback.match();
  
  // Show modal with slight delay for better UX
  setTimeout(() => {
    setShowMatchModal(true);
  }, 100);
} else {
  // Just success haptic for regular like
  feedback.success();
}
```

**Impact:** 
- Match celebrations now play the same celebration sound as Discovery
- Success haptics play for matches
- 100ms delay creates better animation timing
- Consistent user experience across all match scenarios

**Full Implementation:**

State management:
```typescript
const [matchedUser, setMatchedUser] = useState<User | null>(null);
const [showMatchModal, setShowMatchModal] = useState(false);
```

Celebration logic in `handleLike`:
```typescript
const handleLike = async () => {
  if (!selectedUser || isProcessing) return;
  
  setIsProcessing(true);
  try {
    const result = await swipeMutation.mutateAsync({ 
      userId: selectedUser.id, 
      direction: 'right' 
    });
    
    setSelectedUser(null);
    
    if (result.match) {
      setMatchedUser(selectedUser);
      feedback.match(); // üéµ Sound + haptics
      
      setTimeout(() => {
        setShowMatchModal(true);
      }, 100);
    } else {
      feedback.success(); // Just haptics
    }
  } catch (error: any) {
    feedback.error();
    Alert.alert('ÿÆÿ∑ÿ£', error.response?.data?.message || 'ŸÅÿ¥ŸÑ ŸÅŸä ÿ•ÿ±ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿ•ÿπÿ¨ÿßÿ®.');
  } finally {
    setIsProcessing(false);
  }
};
```

Modal rendering:
```typescript
<MatchModal
  visible={showMatchModal}
  currentUser={currentUser ?? null}
  matchedUser={matchedUser}
  onClose={() => {
    setShowMatchModal(false);
    setMatchedUser(null);
  }}
  onSendMessage={() => {
    if (matchedUser) {
      setShowMatchModal(false);
      const userId = matchedUser.id;
      setMatchedUser(null);
      navigation.navigate('Chat', { userId });
    }
  }}
/>
```

## Eligibility Matrix (Bidirectional)

After the fixes, here's the complete eligibility matrix:

| User A Role | User B Role | Can A swipe B? | Can B swipe A? | Bidirectional? |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Male | Female | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Female | Male | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Mother (son) | Female | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No* | ‚úÖ Yes (fixed) |
| Mother (daughter) | Male | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No* | ‚úÖ Yes (fixed) |
| Mother (son) | Mother (daughter) | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Mother (daughter) | Mother (son) | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |

\* While the direct eligibility is "No", the bidirectional check now allows swiping back when the other person swiped first.

   - ‚úÖ Male can swipe right/left on Mother
   - ‚úÖ If Male swipes right, match is created
   - ‚úÖ MatchModal shows for both users

### Scenario 3: Mother (son) ‚Üî Mother (daughter)

## Backend Validation Flow

```
User A swipes on User B
‚Üì
1. Validate User A is not swiping themselves
2. Check if users are blocking each other
3. Validate User A's mother_for (if mother)
4. Validate User B's mother_for (if mother) ‚Üê NEW
5. Check eligibility (can A swipe B?)
6. Save swipe
7. If right swipe:
   - Check for reciprocal swipe
   - If found, create match
   - Return match in response
```

---

## Status

‚úÖ **All 4 issues resolved**
- Mothers now show up in "Liked Me" tab (bidirectional eligibility)
- 422 errors fixed with swipe-back logic
- Likes from mothers now register correctly (validation added)
- Match celebration animation works in "Liked Me" tab

‚úÖ **No linter errors**
‚úÖ **Ready for testing**

## Key Technical Achievement

The swipe-back logic elegantly solves the asymmetric eligibility problem:
- **Normal Discovery:** Strict eligibility rules apply (e.g., Female can only swipe Male)
- **Liked Me / Swipe-Back:** If they already swiped you, you can respond (reciprocity principle)
- This maintains app logic while enabling natural user interactions
