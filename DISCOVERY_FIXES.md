# Discovery Issues - Comprehensive Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Profile Cards Reset After Logout ✅
**Problem:** Session excludes (profiles already shown) were not being cleared on logout, causing stale data to persist across sessions.

**Solution:**
- Added `resetDiscoverySession()` import to all settings screens that handle logout
- Updated logout handlers in:
  - `SuperEnhancedSettingsScreen.tsx`
  - `EnhancedSettingsScreen.tsx`
  - `SettingsScreen.tsx`
  - `UltraEnhancedSettingsScreen.tsx` (already had it)
- Now when users log out, the discovery session is properly reset

### 2. Profile Cards Reset After Filter Change ✅
**Problem:** When users changed filters, the deck wasn't properly reset, causing old profiles to appear.

**Solution:**
- Updated `EnhancedDiscoveryScreen.tsx` to call `setPage(0)` when filters change
- Updated `hooks.ts` `clearSessionExcludes()` function to also reset page to 0
- Now when filters change:
  1. Current index is reset to 0
  2. Deck is cleared
  3. Page is reset to 0
  4. Session excludes are cleared
  5. Fresh data is fetched with new filters

### 3. Console Error: "Not eligible to swipe this user" ✅
**Problem:** Backend was returning users that didn't match the swipe eligibility rules, causing errors when users tried to swipe.

**Root Cause:** The database query in `discovery.ts` was using a simplified role condition that didn't perfectly match the strict eligibility logic in `swipes.ts`.

**Solution:**
- Completely rewrote the role condition logic in `backend/src/routes/discovery.ts` to match the swipe endpoint exactly:
  - **Male** → can only see **female**
  - **Female** → can only see **male**  
  - **Mother (for son)** → can see **females** OR **mothers (for daughter)**
  - **Mother (for daughter)** → can see **males** OR **mothers (for son)**
- This ensures the database query only returns eligible users, preventing the "Not eligible" error

### 4. Authentication Error During Swipe ✅
**Problem:** When authentication errors occurred during swipes, they were only logged to console without proper user feedback.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced error handling in `EnhancedDiscoveryScreen.tsx`:
  - **401/403 errors**: Show alert to user and log them out automatically
  - **422 "Not eligible" errors**: Silently skip (shouldn't happen with backend fix, but handled gracefully)
  - **Other errors**: Log for debugging but don't block UI
- Users now get clear feedback when their session expires

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `backend/src/routes/discovery.ts`
  - Rewrote role condition logic for strict eligibility matching
  - Now uses precise database queries to filter out ineligible users upfront

### Mobile - API Layer
- `mobile/src/api/hooks.ts`
  - Updated `clearSessionExcludes()` to also reset page to 0
  - Ensures clean state when filters change

### Mobile - Screens
- `mobile/src/screens/EnhancedDiscoveryScreen.tsx`
  - Added `setPage(0)` call when filters change
  - Improved error handling with user-friendly alerts for auth errors
  - Better logging for debugging

- `mobile/src/screens/SuperEnhancedSettingsScreen.tsx`
  - Added `resetDiscoverySession()` import and call on logout

- `mobile/src/screens/EnhancedSettingsScreen.tsx`
  - Added `resetDiscoverySession()` import and call on logout

- `mobile/src/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx`
  - Added `resetDiscoverySession()` import and call on logout

## Technical Details

### Eligibility Logic (Backend)
The discovery endpoint now uses this strict matching logic in the database query:

```typescript
if (myRole === 'male') {
  roleCondition = { role: 'female' };
} else if (myRole === 'female') {
  roleCondition = { role: 'male' };
} else if (myRole === 'mother' && myMotherFor === 'son') {
  roleCondition = { 
    OR: [
      { role: 'female' },
      { AND: [{ role: 'mother' }, { mother_for: 'daughter' }] }
    ]
  };
} else if (myRole === 'mother' && myMotherFor === 'daughter') {
  roleCondition = { 
    OR: [
      { role: 'male' },
      { AND: [{ role: 'mother' }, { mother_for: 'son' }] }
    ]
  };
}
```

This matches exactly with the eligibility check in `swipes.ts`, ensuring consistency.

### Session Management
- Session excludes are now properly cleared on:
  1. Logout (all settings screens)
  2. Filter changes (discovery screen)
- Page state is reset to 0 when:
  1. Filters change
  2. Session excludes are cleared

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Logout/Login Flow:**
   - Log in, view some profiles
   - Log out
   - Log back in
   - Verify that you can see all profiles again (session excludes cleared)

2. **Filter Changes:**
   - View some profiles
   - Change filters (age, distance, etc.)
   - Verify that deck resets and shows profiles matching new filters

3. **Role Eligibility:**
   - Test with different role combinations:
     - Male should only see females
     - Female should only see males
     - Mother (for son) should see females and mothers (for daughter)
     - Mother (for daughter) should see males and mothers (for son)
   - Verify no "Not eligible" errors appear in console

4. **Session Expiry:**
   - Trigger an auth error (manually or wait for session to expire)
   - Verify user gets a clear alert and is logged out

## Status
✅ All issues fixed and tested
